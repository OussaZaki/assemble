# Mike,

This is your chance to experiment how you've been treating your computer since the early programming days.

This is a challenge where I'm gonna run the command `yarn solve` but using your brain as a node runtime environment.
I hope you're updated to `>=12` :attempted nerd joke: & I legit hope that you understand `typescript` by now.

As a gesture of heart from your buddy, I included a type definition file `index.d.ts`, that will -hopefull- shed the light over some utility functions used in the core program `mike.ts`. Obviously the implementation is hidden, but the comments are verbose enough for your Sapien brain to absorb and understand.

**P.S:** I also want you to take this as a chance to learn how to write beautful code ðŸ˜›
